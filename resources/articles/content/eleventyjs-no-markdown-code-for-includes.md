**TL;DR:** Scroll to the bottom to see how to use nunjucks whitespace control to correctly render an include within a markdown file.

When I was writing my [Create an API proxy with Cloudflare Workers](/resources/articlesxy-with-cloudflare-workers.md) article I wanted to dynamically include the widget for what I last scrobbled so everyone could see what the purpose should be.

I knew I could set [a default template engine for markdown files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#default-template-engine-for-markdown-files), which is used to parse the files before markdown renders the rest of the file. Since I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for the rest of my site I changed the default from `liquid` to `njk` in my `.eleventy.js` configuration file:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
	return {
		markdownTemplateEngine: 'njk',
	}
}
```

Next, I tried to simply include the same widget I was including on my homepage by writing:

    ```jinja-html
    {% include 'last-tweet.njk' %}
    ```

Unfortunately, this wasn't working as expected and looked like this:

At first I thought it just included the raw code, but then realized that the outer parts seemed to work as expected but then markdowns [Indented code blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#indented-code-blocks) feature kicked in.  
This is also mentioned in the 11ty docs as a [common pitfall](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/#there-are-extra-and-in-my-output).

The docs pointed me in the right direction but I just couldn't find the real culprit of why it wasn't working as expected.

To understand what the problem was let's take a quick look how I implemented that Last Scrobble widget: Basically, we have two templates. One that provides the structure of the card and one that extends it to provide the individual content. I hate to repeat myself so I reach for this pattern as often as I can.

`_last-thing.njk`

    ```jinja-html
    <div>
        <div>
            {% block link %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </div>
    ```

`last-scrobble.njk`

    ```jinja-html
    {% extends '_last-thing.njk' %}

    {% block link %}
        <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Timmotheus">@timmotheus</a>
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
        Dynamic track title and artist
    {% endblock %}
    ```

Turns out: my problem was my notorious need for correctly indenting everything. When providing the content for the blocks I naturally indented everything between the `block` statements, therefore adding to much indentation. Changing it to the following solved my problem:

    ```
    {% extends '_last-thing.njk' %}

    {% block link %}
        <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Timmotheus">@timmotheus</a> [tl! remove]
    <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Timmotheus">@timmotheus</a> [tl! add]
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
        Dynamic track title and artist [tl! remove]
    Dynamic track title and artist [tl! add]
    {% endblock %}
    ```

But that's ugly. [Whitespace control](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#whitespace-control) to the rescue! Quoting from the docs:

> Occasionally you don't want the extra whitespace, but you still want to format the template cleanly, which requires whitespace.

Yep, that's what I wanted. My first instinct was to use it on the `include`. But that was wrong, because my extra whitespace was clearly coming from my blocks. So I changed my implementation of `last-tweet.njk` to this:

    ```
    {% extends '_last-thing.njk' %}

    {% block link %} [tl! remove]
    {%- block link -%} [tl! add]
        <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Timmotheus">@timmotheus</a>
    {% endblock %} [tl! remove]
    {%- endblock -%} [tl! add]

    {% block content %} [tl! remove]
    {%- block content -%} [tl! add]
        Dynamic track title and artist
    {% endblock %} [tl! remove]
    {%- endblock -%} [tl! add]
    ```

**That's it!** You should now be able to include a nunjucks template without any code indentation from markdown messing up your HTML.
