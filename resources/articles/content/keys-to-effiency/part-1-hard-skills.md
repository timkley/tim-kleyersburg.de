**Efficiency is a mindset**. You don't get efficient by learning just one or two skills alone. Instead, you want to master the basics and get into a mental state where you’re always looking for ways to improve. This series is about building a foundation of skills and hopefully inspiring you to keep questioning and improving your workflows.

Imagine a carpenter who needs 10 minutes just to hold his hammer correctly – unimaginable, right? Yet many office workers spend valuable time each day inefficiently using their basic tools like the keyboard and mouse. With just a bit of effort, you could work much faster and with less frustration. This first post is all about the basics for an efficient workflow and why I think it should be your top priority.

## The Keyboard – Your Most Important Tool

The keyboard is the centerpiece of your daily work. Every word, line of code, and almost every interaction with your computer relies on it. If you’re still “hunting and pecking” for each letter as you type, you’re leaving tremendous potential on the table. There’s hardly any other skill in an office environment that can make such a big difference as being able to type quickly and accurately.

### Work on Your Typing Speed

Whether you are a writer, a programmer, or an office worker, typing is a fundamental skill. The faster you can type, the more you can get done in a day. The average typing speed is around 40 words per minute, but with a bit of practice, you can **easily double that**. Just imagine how much time you could save if you could type twice as fast! Or imagine how much time you’ve wasted by not improving this skill earlier.

#### How to Learn to Type Faster

There are plenty of free tools to help you get faster and more accurate. I really liked [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com) for their simple and intuitive interface with a lot of information about your progress.

A few minutes of practice a day is all it takes to develop this skill over the course of a few weeks.

The hardest part is acknowledging that you _need_ to improve. It’s easy to get stuck in your ways and think that you’re “good enough”. Just type a few words into Keybr and look at your speed. I’ll wait. The time you invest in improving your typing speed will pay off in the very near future. And since you’ve chosen to work in front of a computer: don’t you want to be good at it? Or do you want to be the carpenter who can’t handle his hammer?

> **Tip:** Training doesn’t have to take long – 5 minutes a day is a great start. You’ll quickly see progress, and soon you’ll be typing without needing to look at the keyboard!

## Shortcuts – Small Helpers with a Big Impact

Clicking with the mouse may not seem like it takes much time, but over the course of a day, those seconds add up. If you perform the same action repeatedly – like copying and pasting text – it’s worth considering how much time a simple shortcut could save. A shortcut is like a secret “magic trick” that takes you straight to the action you need.

While you might and should be used to the most common shortcuts like `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`, there are many more shortcuts that can save you time and make your work more efficient.  
Take the time to learn the shortcuts for your most-used applications – it’s a small investment that pays off quickly. Just take a look in the menu of your application – most of the time, the shortcuts are listed right next to the action or when you hover over the button with your mouse.

> **Tip**: Don’t overwhelm yourself. Pick one or two new shortcuts each week and practice using them consistently until they become second nature.

Once you get used to shortcuts, your workflow will feel more natural and intuitive – less time spent clicking, more focus on what really matters. And you'll look back at your old self, wondering how you ever got anything done without them.

## Mouse vs. Keyboard

The mouse is certainly useful, but many tasks are quicker to complete with the keyboard. This has two advantages: You save time and avoid moving your hand constantly between the mouse and keyboard – also a lot of little time savers. And it also helps to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can be caused by using the mouse too much.

> Take a closer look at how you’re using your keyboard and mouse this week – where are you losing time? Could a shortcut replace an action you do repeatedly with the mouse?

## Conclusion

Mastering your basic tools is like a carpenter mastering the hammer. The time you invest in developing these foundational skills will pay off in a smoother, more productive workday. Just a few minutes a day practicing the 10-finger method or learning new shortcuts can help you work faster and with less frustration. You'll also stand out amongst your peers as someone who knows how to use their tools efficiently.

I also want to make clear again, that this is not about speed for speed’s sake. You owe it to yourself and your work to use your tools efficiently. It’s about working smarter, not harder. Ask yourself: would you trust a carpenter who can’t handle his hammer?
