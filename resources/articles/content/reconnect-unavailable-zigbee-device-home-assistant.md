If you have ever encountered a situation where a Zigbee device becomes unavailable in Home Assistant, you may be wondering how to easily reconnect it.

Although there's no apparent method to do this in the UI, it's surprisingly easy to accomplish!

## Steps to reconnect an unavailable Zigbee device

1. Open the Settings â†’ Devices & Services page
2. Click on "Add integration"
3. Select "Add Zigbee device"
4. Put your unavailable device into pairing mode

Your device should now re-pair and be available again.

The advantage of this method is that you don't have to remove the device from Home Assistant first, which would break all existing automations.
