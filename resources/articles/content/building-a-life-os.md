## How I define Life OS

The term "Life OS" is often associated with a note taking system helping you manage your life. It does so by given you structures to organize your thoughts, tasks, and goals.

For me, that's not enough. An Operating System should be able to manage your life, not just help you manage it. It should be able to automate tasks, remind you of important things and be truly made for you.

In my opinion a note taking system falls short of that. It's a great tool to help you manage your life, but it's not a Life OS.

## Motivation behind building a Life OS

For multiple months I've juggled with the thought of creating a system that is able to combine all the different digital sources that are part of my life.

The tipping point for me was when my kid got into a new school and got a digital school schedule, namely [Webuntis](https://webuntis.com/). It contains information about the classes, homework and upcoming tests. The concept is great but the UX is, sorry Untis-Team, terrible.

- There are no notifications
- You don't see all homeworks or tests at a glance but have to check _each day individually_
- abbreviations are used that are not explained anywhere

But: they have an API*. So I thought: why not build a system that combines all the different sources of information that are part of my life? I love working with APIs or with data from different sources that do things.

So I started building a Life OS.

_* The API sucks, also. But that's a different story._
