If you ran into the above error before, one of the most common causes is forgetting to define exactly one root element.

So, if your code looks like this:

```html
<template x-if="loading"> Loading... </template>
```

You need to change it to this (instead of a `div` you may use any other valid HTML element):

```html
<template x-if="loading">
	<div>Loading...</div>
</template>
```

As stated in the [Alpine.js docs](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/if), `template` tags may only contain one root element, and text in itself does not qualify as an element.
