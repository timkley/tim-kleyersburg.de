# tim-kleyersburg.de

This is the repository to my private site [tim-kleyersburg.de](https://www.tim-kleyersburg.de).

It uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). All styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), Code highlighting comes from the amazing [torchlight.dev](https://torchlight.dev).

To develop locally just run `composer install` and `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
